- 👋 Hi, I’m @GitaekKang-Physics
- 👀 I’m interested in Condensed Matter Physics, Quantum Computing, Quantum Information Science
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, C++, C#,R,  MATLAB, Julia, LaTeX
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Computational Science, Computer Science, Computational Physics, Condensed Matter Physics in MATLAB, C++, Analysis(SDEs, Probabilities)
- 📫 How to reach me via Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn(https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-kang-996b30271?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=android_app), Kakaotalk, E-mail(sciencepoli@snu.ac.kr, qmalzp113@naver.com)
- 😄 Pronouns: I believe in traditional values, so I won't submit to this section
- ⚡ Fun fact: I actually do Business Administration as my main major and do Physics as my second major. But I'm way more focused on STEM and I will be solving(or perhaps, uploading) mainly about computer science and computational science regarding physics and statistics.
